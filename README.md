# Contacts Application ☎️

## Project Description 🎨

This project is the building block on which my Multi-Platform Development journey begins. Utilizing Microsoft's newly created .NET MAUI Platform,
I begin a journey which aims to improve my proficiency in C# and XAML, as well as my understanding of the .NET Framework.

## Project Set-up & Configuration  💻

### Prerequisites 📋

- JetBrains Rider 2023
- .NET MAUI (Platform Package Downloadable within JetBrains Rider Installation)
- .NET 7.0 SDK
- iOS Simulator (XCode)


## Skills Demonstrated 🥋

This project provided a basis for understanding the operations required for effective user experience in a functional cross-platform application. The following skills were demonstrated:

- **MVVM**: The Model-View-ViewModel 3-core pattern was utilized to create a clean separation of concerns between the UI and the business logic. This allowed for a more efficient and effective development process, as well as a more maintainable codebase.

- **C#**: A singular codebase in C# was utilized to create the project structure and logic implementation in the codebehind.


- **XAML**: Extensible Application Markup Language used for the UI design and layout of the application.
